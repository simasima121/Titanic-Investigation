#Project: Investigating the Titanic Dataset
In this project, I analysed the titanic dataset, posed questions and communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to do the analysis.

##Required Libraries and Dependencies
### Language
* [Python][1] 

###Installations
* [Anaconda][2] which comes with the following libraries:
	- pandas
	- numpy
	- matplotlib
	- csv

##How to Run Project
1. Using terminal, navigate to the files root directory.
2. Type **jupyter notebook Titanic_Investigation.ipynb** to launch the IPython Notebook.
3. Under the link Cell, select Run all to ensure all code blocks have been run (Need to run all blocks at beginning as values not stored when Notebook is shutdown).
4. To log out, enter ctrl-c twice in the terminal.
